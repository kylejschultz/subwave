// Regression tests for the pick-attached link's spoken clock (#1314).
// Run: `tsx scripts/link-clock.test.ts`.
//
// A link is written when the pick is MADE but airs when the pick STARTS, so the
// time it may speak is a forecast: `linkAirDate(showAt)` = now + whatever is
// left of the on-air track. #864 introduced the forecast (before it, links
// spoke generation time and aired a track late), #1282 removed a fixed +120s
// show-attribution padding that made every forecast run two minutes fast.
//
// What neither fixed: the forecast only holds if the pick reaches Liquidsoap
// before the on-air track ends. When the round outruns that, dj_queue is empty
// at the seam, auto.m3u fills the slot, and the pick airs at the END of the
// filler — with a link still naming the moment the filler STARTED. The old
// +120s overshoot had been masking that undershoot on average, which is why
// removing it surfaced as "the clock now runs minutes BEHIND air".
//
// Two pure guards close it, pinned here:
//
//  - linkClockAt      — refuses to hand out a clock at all when too little of
//                       the on-air track is left for the forecast to be worth
//                       anything. This is the prevention: measured over 788
//                       pick rounds, 27.7% ran longer than 45s of runway but
//                       only 0.3% longer than 120s, and the exposed population
//                       (maybeDeadlinePick's empty-queue backstop) always fires
//                       inside that window.
//  - linkClockDrifted — drops the line at air time when the seam landed too far
//                       from the forecast anyway. This is the backstop for the
//                       0.3% tail; the audio is already cut, so silence on one
//                       hand-off beats a wrong time, exactly the trade
//                       shouldDropStaleLink already makes for a wrong name.
