//                           optional dimension, and if not, why not?
//   failureCountsAgainstTrack — does a thrown analysis count as evidence about

//
// All three widenings — CLAP "sounds-like" vectors, Demucs vocal ranges and the
// stem cache — face the same three-way capability question, and the third answer
// is the one that was missing. `capable === false` used to mean exactly one
// thing (the image was built without the model) and the message said so: "switch
// to the heavy image". A heavy image whose weights fail to download lands on the
// same false and got the same message, which is advice to do the thing already
// done.

// broken analyzer finds out what broke.

// order five tracks per three passes — and an excluded track can't self-heal,
