// Order: the operator's CONFIGURED fallback first (their explicit second
// choice, engine AND voice), then the configured default engine, then Piper
// (the universal local floor), then Kokoro (for the case where Piper itself was
// the failed primary). The primary, duplicates, and anything the caller's
// `usable` gate rejects are dropped — so the chain never re-attempts the engine
// that just threw, and never attempts one the pre-flight gate already knows
// can't speak. A disabled fallback (`configured` null) reproduces the
// pre-fallback order exactly.
//
// Dedup is by ENGINE, first-wins: when the configured fallback and the default
// engine name the same engine, the configured slot survives and its voice is
// what speaks. Without that, the operator's chosen voice would be silently
// replaced by the engine's global default on exactly the station where both
// were pointed at the same engine.
//
// Note dedup stays engine-keyed even though EXCLUSION is provider-keyed for
// cloud (see sameTtsTarget). That asymmetry is deliberate: a failed provider
// must not blacklist a healthy sibling, but once one cloud rung is in the
// chain a second one buys another network round-trip on the same dispatcher
// while the local floor is still waiting below. One cloud attempt per rescue.
//
// `usable` receives the slot's own cloud provider for the configured rung and
// null for the hardcoded ones — the probe must agree with the call, and a
// hardcoded cloud rung speaks with the station default's credentials.
