excerpt: Drop a folder into state/skills and your DJ picks up a new between-track bit, whether a moon phase, a local headline, or whatever you want it to mention.
---

The little things your DJ does between songs, like a weather note, a quick headline, or a daft aside, are what we call skills. A few ship in the box. Now you can write your own, and you don't have to touch the station's code to do it.

## What's new

A skill is one between-track line. The DJ glances at something, then either says a sentence over the intro of the next track or stays quiet. That's the whole job. You add one by dropping a folder into `state/skills/`.

## How to use it

Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` inside. The frontmatter sets the name and how often it can fire; the markdown body is the brief the DJ actually follows: what to say, the tone, when to keep mum. The full frontmatter reference is in the manual's [Custom Skills](/manual/skills) page.

```
state/skills/
  moon-phase/
    SKILL.md      # frontmatter + the DJ's brief
    tool.mjs      # optional: fetches live data before the DJ speaks
```

There's a ready-made example in the repo at `docs/examples/skills/moon-phase`. Copy it into `state/skills/`, open the admin Skills page, and hit Rescan. Your skill shows up in the list, ready to toggle on.

![The admin Skills page: a table of skills, each with its brief, cooldown and how many DJs may run it, a Run now button and an on/off switch. The ones written by hand carry a CUSTOM tag next to their name](/screenshots/admin-skills.webp)

Want it to react to real data? Add a `tool.mjs` and the DJ can check something live, like tonight's moon or the surf report, before it opens its mouth.

## The ones that ship are yours too

The skills that come in the box are files now, same as your own. On first boot they land in `state/skills/`, so you can open one up and rewrite its brief or change how often it fires. The handy one: the news skill reads the BBC by default. Not your part of the world? Open it on the admin Skills page, paste your own RSS feed, rewrite the brief in your station's voice, and it's reading your headlines on the next break. No restart, no editing `.env`.

## Why it bothers

Your station starts to sound like yours. The bits between tracks stop being generic and start being the things you actually care about, in the voice you picked. And a brief that lands doesn't have to stay home: skills can [travel between stations](/news/pass-a-skill-along), and the public catalog at [/skills](/skills) shows what other operators run.
